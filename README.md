Hello, I'm Anderson. 

I've always harbored the ambition of becoming an efficient developer, and I turned that aspiration into reality after crossing the age of 45. 

With a background in electronic engineering, I navigated through technical and operational roles in content production, streaming and audiovisual broadcasting. Now, having transitioned from a successful career in engineering, I'm pursuing my passion as a professional developer. 

Extracting insights from messaging platforms fuels my drive to excel.
